### Pixel Breaker Legacy

When i started working in communication agencies, a coworker had this nice screensaver on his laptop. Now I learned javascript, I wanted to reproduce it as a challenge. It started when i had my MVC in javascript lesson where we used an eventEmitter to create a clock.

So the entire idea belong to Pixel breaker, I'm just trying to do a simple copycat for the pleasure.
